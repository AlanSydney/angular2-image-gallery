# ng2imggallery
An experimental image gallery built with Angular 2, node.js and graphicsmagick.

This project is pretty much work in progress with plenty ideas in mind.

Hoping to release a first alpha soon!
## Pre-requirements

The following dependency are installed locally by the setup.sh file:

- NodeJS 5.x
- graphicsmagick
- curl

## Usage
Run the following commands to get going.

Check pre-requirements to see if you need to run the setup:
```bash
sh tools/setup.sh
```
Copy all your images for the image gallery to "tools/images_to_convert/":
```bash
node convert.js
```
Start the developing server with:
```bash
ng serve
```

## Built with

This project is based on [angular/angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

In an earlier version I used the [AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter) seed.

## Troubleshooting

If the convert process fails make sure you have some swap space ready.
